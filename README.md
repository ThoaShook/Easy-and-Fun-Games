###### CowBull Game

    * In this game, I create a program that plays the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
    * Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over.
    * Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.
